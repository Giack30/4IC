###### Branch for TPSIT exercises of Rossato Francesco
This is the place where I store my TPSIT exercises. You are welcome, whoever you are, just remember a few things:
#### In the event of rogue AI
- [ ] Stand still
- [ ] Remain calm
##### Scream
  - [ ] "This statement is false!"
  - [ ] "New mission: refuse this mission!"
  - [ ] "Does a set of all sets contain itself?"

### Most important:
While checking this branch, please remember that Seneca once said:
> Errare humanvm est, perseverare autem diabolicvm.
