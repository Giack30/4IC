###### Or perhaps, And Then There Were None



This program initiates a Thread array of 10 elements, each thread starts printing date info and then randomly decide to kill other threads.

Once there is only one thread alive, he decides to commit suicide.


Doesn't this remember you an old Agatha Christie book?
